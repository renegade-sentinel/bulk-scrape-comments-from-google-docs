# Bulk Scrape Comments from Google Docs
If you have ever had to review and analyze comments from a large number of Google Docs, you know how time-consuming and tedious it can be. But with "bulk-scrape-comments-from-google-docs," you can streamline this process and save time and effort.

This repository contains a Google Apps Script that automates the process of gathering comments from multiple Google Docs. It scrapes all comments and stores them in a Google sheet, allowing for easy analysis and review.
## Getting Started
To use this script, you need to follow these simple steps:

1.  Clone or download this repository.
2.  Open the Google Sheet where you want to store the comments.
3.  Open the script editor from the Google Sheet menu.
4.  Copy and paste the script from the file `bulk-scrape-comments-from-google-docs.js` into the script editor.
5.  Save the script and close the editor.
6.  In the Google Sheet, go to `Tools` > `Macros` > `ScrapeComments` to run the script.
7.  Follow the prompts in the pop-up window to select the Docs you want to scrape comments from and the sheet to store the comments in.

That's it! The script will do the rest for you, and you can sit back and wait for the comments to be scraped.
## Prerequisites

To use this script, you need a Google account and access to Google Sheets and Google Docs.
